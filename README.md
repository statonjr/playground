# Playground

Learning ClojureScript with Reagent.

Repo created with the [Tux](https://github.com/statonjr/tux) Leiningen template.

## Usage

Clone the repo, then run:

```
lein cljsbuild auto
```

Open `target/index.html` to see the output.

## Current Progress

Working on creating a standardized set of Reagent components that conform to a style guide. These components can be composed together to make a user interface.
